    for an account by entering your email and choosing a password (your “Account
    Credentials''). When you engage with or sign into the Newsela Platform, in
    addition to your Account Credentials, you may be providing your name, phone
    number, and/or other contact information to Newsela. You are solely
    responsible for protecting and maintaining the secrecy of your Account
    Credentials. You shall not allow another person to use your Account
    Credentials to access the Newsela Platform. Newsela will not be responsible
    or liable for any loss or damage that results from your failure to comply
    with this security obligation. You are solely responsible for any and all
    activities or actions that occur under your account, whether or not you have
    authorized such activities or actions. You agree to immediately notify
    Newsela, pursuant to Section 14(g), of any unauthorized use of your Account
    Credentials. You certify that you are over at least 13 years of age, you
    have provided your own contact information, and that the information you
    have provided is accurate. Upon registration and the submission of such
    contact information, you consent and give permission to be contacted at such
    e-mail address, phone number, or other methods by Newsela. If you use the
    services with students under 13, you represent and warrant that (a) you are
    a teacher, parent or administrator at a school and (b) if you are a teacher
    or administrator, that you have accurately identified such school upon
    registration. The Newsela Platform is designed for use by schools, school
    districts, school administrators, Local Education Agencies, teachers,
    caregivers, and student users.  If you are a teacher, you warrant and
    represent that you are authorized to use the Newsela Platform with your
    students on behalf of your school and/or school district.  If you are a
    school, a school district or a teacher using individual accounts on behalf
    of your students or providing students with access to the Newsela Platform,
    you warrant and represent that you are authorized to act on a parents’ or
    legal guardians’ behalf in providing such access and any student information
    to Newsela as required under applicable law or that you have obtained
    verifiable consent from parents or legal guardians of your students in
    accordance to the laws governing your jurisdiction. Newsela reserves the
    right to provide or deny access to a student’s account upon an authorized
    adult’s request. In the event that you are no longer (a) employed by your
    school (or another school through which you access the Newsela Platform) or
    (b) otherwise authorized to view or use Student records, you (i) must notify
    Newsela immediately of such change and (ii) are not permitted to continue to
    view or use your Account and the data available as part of that access. b.
    Customer Agreements Customer agreements are entered into between Newsela and
    either a school, a school district, a state or another entity that has legal
    authorization to share administrator, teacher and student data with Newsela.
    If Newsela becomes aware that the signatory did not have authority to sign
    the agreement with Newsela, Newsela reserves the right to terminate such
    agreement and all related accounts. c. Memberships When you register for an
    account on the Newsela Platform, depending on the service offering, you may
    have the option to choose from several types of membership plans. For
    certain membership plans, a credit card will be required to authorize
    payment at the time of registration and billing cycles will be selected and
    designated at the time of registration. Depending on the membership plan you
    have selected, your membership may automatically renew at the end of the
    subscription period unless you cancel your membership before the end of the
    then-current subscription period, which you may do at any time through the
    Newsela Platform or by contacting Newsela at the email address set forth in
    the “Contact Information” section below. Any cancellation will take effect
    at the end of the current billing cycle. No refund will be issued for the
    current billing cycle. If you do not provide timely notice of non-renewal,
    you hereby authorize Newsela to charge the then-current renewal fees to the
    credit card associated with your account. Depending on the membership plan
    you have selected, Newsela may provide notice to you prior to the automatic
    renewal of your subscription. You will pay Newsela the fees specified in the
    membership plan for which you have subscribed, and Newsela reserves the
    right to change the fees at any time upon notice to you. Payments are due
    upon receipt of invoice. All payments for both individual teacher
    subscriptions and school partnerships are considered final and are not
    eligible for refund. If you have any billing issues or questions, you must
    notify Newsela in writing by email at billing@newsela.com or support chat
    available on our services within five (5) calendar days of the issue being
    identified. Any billing issues older than five (5) calendar days will not be
    considered. 3. Limited Right to Use; User Conduct Subject to your compliance

    ARISING BY USAGE OF TRADE, COURSE OF DEALING, OR COURSE OF PERFORMANCE. NO
    ADVICE OR INFORMATION, WHETHER ORAL OR WRITTEN, OBTAINED BY YOU FROM US
    THROUGH THE NEWSELA PLATFORM SHALL CREATE ANY WARRANTY, REPRESENTATION OR
    GUARANTEE NOT EXPRESSLY STATED IN THESE TERMS. YOU AGREE THAT YOUR USE OF
    THE NEWSELA PLATFORM AND THE SERVICES SHALL BE AT YOUR SOLE RISK. NEWSELA

    ANY AND ALL LIABILITY OR LOSS ARISING OUT OF ANY ACTION TAKEN IN RELIANCE ON
    THE NEWSELA PLATFORM AND/OR ANY NEWSELA CONTENT PROVIDED ON THE NEWSELA
    PLATFORM. YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT ANY NEWSELA CONTENT AND/OR DATA
    ACCESSED, DOWNLOADED, OR OTHERWISE OBTAINED THROUGH THE USE OF THE NEWSELA

    Liability IN NO EVENT WILL NEWSELA AND/OR OUR LICENSORS OR OTHER THIRD
    PARTIES MENTIONED ON THE NEWSELA PLATFORM BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR ANY DAMAGES,
    INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DIRECT, INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR
    CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, DAMAGES RELATING TO THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE
    NEWSELA PLATFORM, THE NEWSELA CONTENT, OR OTHER INFORMATION CONTAINED ON THE
    NEWSELA PLATFORM, WHETHER BASED ON WARRANTY, CONTRACT, STATUTE, REGULATION,
    TORT (INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, NEGLIGENCE), OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY
    AND WHETHER OR NOT ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. IN NO EVENT
    WILL NEWSELA AND/OR OUR LICENSORS BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANYONE ELSE FOR ANY
    DECISION MADE OR ACTION TAKEN BY YOU IN RELIANCE ON THE NEWSELA CONTENT
    PROVIDED ON THE NEWSELA PLATFORM. IF ANY EXCLUSION, DISCLAIMER, OR OTHER
    PROVISION CONTAINED IN THESE TERMS IS HELD TO BE INVALID FOR ANY REASON BY A
    COURT OF COMPETENT JURISDICTION, AND NEWSELA OR ONE OF ITS AFFILIATES,
    OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, AGENTS, OR EMPLOYEES BECOMES LIABLE FOR LOSS OR DAMAGE
    THAT COULD OTHERWISE BE LIMITED, THE MAXIMUM, AGGREGATE LIABILITY OF NEWSELA
    AND/OR OUR LICENSORS AND ANY OF THEIR AFFILIATES TO YOU FOR ALL CLAIMS
    ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THE USE OF, OR INABILITY TO USE, ANY PORTION
    OF THE NEWSELA PLATFORM OR OTHERWISE UNDER THESE TERMS, WHETHER UNDER
    CONTRACT, TORT, OR OTHERWISE, IS LIMITED TO THE GREATER OF (I) ONE HUNDRED
    DOLLARS ($100.00 USD), OR (II) THE AMOUNT ACTUALLY PAID BY YOU TO NEWSELA
    HEREUNDER IN THE TWELVE (12) MONTHS PRECEDING THE DATE YOU FIRST BRING A
    CLAIM. BECAUSE SOME STATES/JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR
    LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, THE ABOVE
    LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. THE NEGATION AND LIMITATION OF DAMAGES SET
    FORTH HEREIN ARE FUNDAMENTAL ELEMENTS OF THE BASIS OF THE BARGAIN BETWEEN
    YOU AND NEWSELA. THE NEWSELA PLATFORM WOULD NOT BE PROVIDED WITHOUT SUCH
    LIMITATIONS. IF YOU ARE A RESIDENT OF NEW JERSEY, TO THE EXTENT NEW JERSEY
    LAW PROHIBITS THE LIMITATIONS AND/OR EXCLUSIONS OF LIABILITY SET FORTH IN
    THESE TERMS, SUCH LIMITATIONS AND/OR EXCLUSIONS SHALL NOT APPLY TO YOU. Any
    claim or cause of action arising out of or related to your use of the
    Newsela Platform, these Terms, or your use of the Newsela Content made
    available through or on the Newsela Platform must be filed within one (1)
    year after such claim or cause of action arose or it shall forever be
    barred, notwithstanding any statute of limitations or other law to the
    contrary. 12. Indemnity Unless applicable law requires otherwise, You agree
    to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Newsela, its affiliates,
    shareholders, directors, officers, co-branders, subsidiaries, parents,
    employees and agents, and, at our sole election, defend the foregoing, from
    any claim, demand, liability, dispute, damage, cost, expense, or loss,
    including attorneys’ fees and costs of litigation, arising out of or in any
    way related to your use of or access to the Newsela Platform, your use of
    the Newsela Content, your Data, your violation of these Terms, your
    violation of any rights of a third party, your violation of applicable laws,
    or any negligence, fraudulent, or willful misconduct by or on behalf of you
    or your Authorized Users. 13. Dispute Resolution Please read this section
    carefully. Except as the Terms otherwise provide, you waive your rights to
    try any claim in court before a judge or jury and to bring or participate in
    any class, collective, or other representative action. You agree that any
    dispute arising out of or relating in any way to your use of the Newsela
    Platform requires that the claim be resolved exclusively by confidential,
    binding arbitration except that, to the extent you have in any manner
    violated or threatened to violate the Newsela Content and any intellectual
    property rights therein, Newsela may seek injunctive or other appropriate
    relief. The arbitration shall be conducted before three neutral arbitrators
    in the State of New York, U.S.A., in accordance with the rules of the
    Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services (“JAMS”), as then in effect. No
    claims of any other parties may be joined or otherwise combined in the
    arbitration proceeding. Unless otherwise expressly required by applicable
    law, each party shall bear its own attorneys’ fees without regard to which
    party is deemed the prevailing party in the arbitration proceeding. Except
    for punitive and consequential damages (which may not be awarded), and
    subject to these Terms, the arbitrators shall be authorized to award either
    party any provisional or equitable remedy permitted by applicable law. The
    parties shall equally share all JAMS charges and fees associated with the
    arbitration. BECAUSE THE USE OF THE NEWSELA PLATFORM REQUIRES THE
    ARBITRATION OF ANY CLAIMS OR DISPUTES EXISTING BETWEEN THE PARTIES, NEITHER
    PARTY WILL HAVE THE RIGHT TO PURSUE THAT CLAIM IN COURT OR BEFORE A JUDGE OR
    JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION OR ANY OTHER COLLECTIVE OR
    REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. THE ARBITRATORS’ DECISION WILL BE FINAL AND
    BINDING. OTHER RIGHTS THAT EITHER PARTY WOULD HAVE IF SUCH PARTY WENT TO
    COURT, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION THE RIGHT TO CONDUCT DISCOVERY OR TO
    APPEAL, MAY BE LIMITED OR UNAVAILABLE IN ARBITRATION. The award of the
    arbitrators may be enforced in any court having jurisdiction thereof. Each
    party consents (a) to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the
    State of New York, or to any federal court located within the State of New
    York for any action (i) to compel arbitration, (ii) to enforce any award of
    the arbitrators, or (iii) at any time prior to the qualification and
    appointment of the arbitrators, for temporary, interim, or provisional
    equitable remedies, and (b) to service of process in any action by
    registered mail or any other means provided by law. Nothing herein shall
    prohibit Newsela from seeking a temporary restraining order, preliminary
    injunction, or other provisional relief if, in its judgment, such action is
    necessary to avoid irreparable damage; and nothing herein shall prevent
